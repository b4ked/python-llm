3.06 It appears the symptoms settled as there are no further consultations recorded relating to these injuries. The witness statement from Mrs Pink advises that these physical symptoms settled three weeks after the initial injury.

3.07 In the statement from Mrs Pink she also mentions that after the fall she suffered some headaches, trouble sleeping and a loss of confidence.  

3.07 Mrs Pink reports that she is left with a scar on her chin.

4 Examination Findings

4.01 Mrs Pink attended for an examination with me on the 27th November 2010, accompanied by her son, Mr John Holmes.

4.02 Mrs Pink gave a clear account of her injuries, suffering a laceration to her jaw when she fell to the ground. The wound required steristrip and afterwards her jaw was painful to the degree that for a few days she was only drinking soup through a straw and felt pain whenever she laughed. A few days later she felt achiness across her chest wall and neck and the stronger painkillers prescribed by the GP helped but she was still uncomfortable at night causing some restless nights. Mrs Pink reports that theses physical symptoms continued just beyond the new year of 2010, taking her up to 4 weeks post initial injury.

4.03 There is a 2 centimetres diameter crescent shaped scar just underneath her chin with a maximum thickness of 2 millimetres in keeping with a healed laceration caused by falling onto the pavement. Mrs Pink reported that she is very conscious of this scar and tries to cover it with make-up.  

4.04 Mrs Pink reported a significant loss in confidence after the fall. She was afraid to go out alone, especially with it being winter, therefore colder and darker. She was a member of a walking group that would regularly hike ten miles but she did not rejoin that group for some months.  

4.05 It was not until the February 2010, some 2 months after the fall, that Mrs Pink felt the confidence to go out for walks alone and not until March when she re-joined her walking group, taking it slow at first.   

4.06 Mrs Pink reported that this fall has consequently affected her confidence even now, one year afterwards, in that she had never fallen before and it has shaken her confidence to a degree that she is still much more wary when walking alone or unfamiliar territory and has slowed done quite a bit. She now also walks with 2 trekking poles for stability.

5 My Opinion

5.01 Clearly Mrs Pink suffered scarring to her chin as a result of the fall. I understand photographs have been provided with the statement of claim.

5.02 It is very much more likely than not that the physical symptoms of jaw ache and stiffness, chest wall pain, neck stiffness and headaches were as a result of the fall. The jolting mechanism of falling to solid ground on one’s front is commonly associated with these symptoms. Mrs Pink also suffered difficulty sleeping in relation to the discomfort she was in and this would be expected. Mrs Pink confirms that these symptoms lasted for up to 4 weeks, which would be as reasonably expected.

5.03 Psychologically, following the fall Mrs Pink suffered lost confidence in her ability to walk unaided, cancelling several planned walks with friends and it took some months for her confidence to gradually return, leaving a residual wariness which was not present prior to the fall. In my experience, as a fulltime GP, I have seen many patients who have fallen and it is very common that they lose confidence, which once lost, takes time to re-build. I would class this loss of confidence as a reasonable and normal reaction to such a fall and Mrs Pink may find that some wariness remains for life.

5.04 Regarding the scar, in my opinion it is unlikely that there is much that can be done surgically to improve the look of this scar. Mrs Pink does report that she is able to hide it with make-up. A cosmetic Plastic Surgeon could be instructed to comment further and advise whether he felt he could excise the scar and re-suture it to make a very thin barely noticeable scar, however you may find that he would not believe it to be possible given the crescent nature and its location in an area of the face known to carry a certain amount of torsion.
